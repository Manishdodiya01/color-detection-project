# Color Detection Web Application

This is a web application that allows users to detect the color of any pixel in an image. Users can either upload an image from their computer, input an image URL, or use other methods to input an image. The backend is powered by **Flask** and **OpenCV**, while the frontend is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Color Detection**: Click on an image to detect the color of any pixel at that point.
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Upload images from your computer or provide an image URL.
- **Responsive Interface**: The interface is mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Simple and User-Friendly**: Easy to navigate with minimal setup required.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used for creating the backend API.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful computer vision library that processes images for color detection.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Used for building the responsive frontend interface.
- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity by allowing users to click on the image to detect colors.
- **Python (3.x)**: The core language for backend functionality and image processing.
